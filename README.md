# Peculiar-Dimension-EA
   Hello! Peculiar Dimension is a game I made up and created for class PRO385 over at Neumont College of Computer Science. It was a fun project, but due to some scary events at some very unfortunate time I wasn't able to bring this project to its full glory in the allotted time. I'm still very glad to be able to make this much progress, and keep moving forward in both mine and spirit. If your following this project you can expect kind of an overhaul sometime in the future. The true motive and system for this game is something really cool I want to return to someday.
   This game was supposed to be about a young wizard who explores a dungeon based on geometric shapes, which physics based combat. However, now it is a prequel. The reason for why the dungeon is so angry to its visitors, is because the incredibly greedy and 2D SQARE attacked the Olbs in their very own home for their coins. 
   So, you play as a little square fella with a stick that I designed, created, animated, and imported in a 1 hour 30 minute video. The gameplay is pretty simple, you need to defeat the angry sphere enemies by rotating your weapon with the mouse along the opponent, while avoiding contact. They only harm you when they jump, and if you get hit you empty your pockets of gold. If you keep collecting gold when your pockets are full you trample them making them useless. Finally when you have the gold you want you head over to the kind of obstructing deposit area to dump the coins away. Then you repeat while you steal money and avoid the horde.
   For this project I used C#, Unity, Visual Studio, Clip Studio Paint, Aseprite, Smack Studio, JSFXR, suno.ai, and Audacity

Technically the game is pretty simple. The major systems is the Coins, Enemies, and Player. Coins, associated with a prefab and collider, are always checking collisions to see if it hits the player. If it does, it gets collected, deleted, and added to the pockets. Then you can dump them to get closer to the coin goal. For enemies, they take a moment to look for you before targeting and jumping constantly to you. If they hit you mid jump you drop your coins. You become immune for a short time, but by design you can't collect coins either until your prepared again. If defeated enemies drop a bunch of coins, which kinda explodes in a briefly fun way. They also drop themselves, which is useless until later on in future updates.
  During this project my main technical issue was the weapon you use and how you attack. There were a handful of ways the attack system could go, but some of them went nowhere. Setting up an attack in a 2D plane is pretty easy, setting up an attack based off a 3d models attack is abit harder. But for some reason the isometric 2D sprite in 3D was throwing me for a loop. I still couldn't quite figure out how to get the stick to rotate along a different access, but I think some other problems caused me to overlook it.
   To play this game, you download this zip and unzip it somewhere into a new folder. Possibly your desktop so you don't forget to clean it up later on. Once its unzipped, you will have to download Unity as there is no exe here. Once you have it downloaded you open the app and you should be in a launcher. Top right should be an Add button with a dropdown. Click add, and go ahead and grab the folder you unzipped and let Unity open that folder. Make sure that the folder you 'Open' isnt just holding another singular folder, and then opening it shows a handful of different files.
   Now you should see a big green arrow ontop of the screen. WHen you push that, the game will start along with the bells and whistles. Enjoy, and since you downloaded Unity why don't you give it a try at making a game. Its gonna be some work, and you may need to look up stuff for help, but it is a pretty fun experience. Just don't beat yourself up over it. Have a good day.
